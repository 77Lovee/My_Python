# My Python
> Start coding with Python

### Write Before
Python is one of the most popular programing languages. For years,
 many programmers like me have felt its charm -- simple and easy to start with. You may ask what we can do with Python,
 My anwser is EVERYTHING. When you really step into the world of Python, you will be amazed at the power of it.<br/>
 
 I have been leaning coding with Python for a while, doing some interesting projects ,or we can call them small programs.
 For me, Python is  the very tool to represent my thoughts, in a straight way. One of its highlights is that there are so many
 libraries we can access to for free, which means we can save a lot of time to repeat coding some functions, and quickly start
 a project with APIs.
